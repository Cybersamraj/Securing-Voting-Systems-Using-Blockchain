# Securing-Voting-Systems-Using-Blockchain
The purpose of this code is to show the front end approach to a practical use of blockchain in voting systems.
We start by creating a class for both the block and the blockchain.
The block class contains the method of hashing and then return the values to be presented.

Each block will show:
-Block Hash
-Block No
-Block Data
-Time Stamp

There will be a home screen which will allow you to access the voting sysytem with the login id:
- 1234

The selection of candidtaes to be voted for are:
-JACK DOWRY
-KATE HOLLAND

There are various error handling measures implemented throughout the code.
Once you have made your vote, it will be added to the chain and you will be directed backto the home screen.
This process may be repeated and for each time it is the chain will get longer and its length displayed.
